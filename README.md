### How to send a request?

The [`ajax.api/send-request!`](documentation/cljs/ajax/API.md#send-request) function
sends an AJAX request to the given uri by the given method.

```
(send-request! {:method :post
                :uri    "/my-uri"})
```

You can set a progress handler function which takes the request-id and the current
progress value as its parameters.

```
(defn my-progress-handler-f
  [request-id request-progress]
  (println "This request is" request-progress "% done."))

(send-request! {:method             :post
                :progress-handler-f my-progress-handler-f
                :uri                "/my-uri"})
```

Both the error handler and the response handler function takes the request-id
and the server response as its parameters.

```
(defn my-error-handler-f
  [request-id server-response]
  (println "Something went wrong:" server-response))

(defn my-response-handler-f
  [request-id server-response]
  (println "I got the answer:" server-response))

(send-request! {:method             :post
                :error-handler-f    my-error-handler-f
                :response-handler-f my-response-handler-f
                :uri                "/my-uri"})
```

### How to abort an ongoing request?

The [`ajax.api/abort-request!`](documentation/cljs/ajax/API.md#abort-request)
function immediately stops the ongoing request with the given id.

First you should do is that to send the request with a specified id what can
be useful when you want to abort your request.

```
(send-request! :my-request
               {:method :post
                :uri    "/my-uri"})

(abort-request! :my-request)
```

An alternative way is to keep the return value of the
[`ajax.api/send-request!`](documentation/cljs/ajax/API.md#send-request) function
which is the id of the sent request.

```
(def REQUEST-ID (send-request! {:method :post :uri "/my-uri"}))

(abort-request! REQUEST-ID)
```

### CSRF token

To use a CSRF token in request headers you have to place an element in the DOM
tree with the `data-csrf-token` attribute and you have to set the actual token
as its value.

```
[:div {:data-csrf-token "..."}]
```
